Disadvantages Appimage

* No mandatory integration with your desktop (because concept is based on redundant UX: you copy file in /home folder and you can see it in your file manager. But modern systems separate app and app icon, didn't use $HOME path for store binaries and other reasons)
* No usually ways to install AppImage
  * Web: appImage.github.io has old UI/UX, legacy apps, poor info about app
no support any protocols (e.g. appstream)
  * No software center (Gui-wrapper for any AppImage manager)
  * No mandatory condition for signature retention and check before install
  * No mandatory sandbox
  * Support GLIBC-only distros
